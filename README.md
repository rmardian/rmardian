I am Rizki, a computer scientist turned synthetic biologist. I am very passionate about the engineering and programming biological systems directed by computational approaches (both mechanistic models, such as ODE-based systems; and data-driven models, such as machine learning). I am also fascinated with designing and utilizing lab automation platforms for high-throughput experiments, and accelerating efforts in the lab in building large-scale synthetic biology applications. As a computer scientist, I have a strong programming, software engineering, and mathematical modeling background. As a synthetic biologist, I have extensive experiences in working with modular recombinant DNA techniques, such as Type IIS assembly, modular cloning, gibson, etc. to design, build, and test bacterial genetic circuits using E.Coli as the model organism.
